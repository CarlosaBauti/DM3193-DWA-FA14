This is my favorite website, http://nesoupfactorysalem.com/soups-of-the-day. I visit it almost every day. It’s not responsive. It’s not optimized for iPhone. It looks blurry on a Retina display. It doesn’t use the latest HTML5/CSS3 framework. It doesn’t have a thoughtful vertical rhythm. The fonts are nothing special. It is neither skeumorphic nor flat. It doesn’t have its own favicon. It doesn’t have a native app or Twitter or Instagram. It doesn’t use AJAX or SCRUM or node.js or Sinatra. It doesn’t have an API or an RSS feed or VC funding. It hasn’t been featured on a prominent tech blog or won an award. It tells me the soups of the day.

Freely distributed information that’s relevant to the person reading it. That’s web design. 


## Welcome to Web Studio 2!

In this course, students focus on client and server side programming, as well as the web design and development process. Students are also introduced to databases for the web. Examples of dynamic web applications include content management systems, registration systems, and social media solutions.


### PROGRAM GOALS

The following IDM program goals are reinforced within this course. Students will:

* 1 – Students will develop **conceptual thinking skills** to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
  * Students will develop a research and studio practice through inquiry and iteration.
* 2 – Students will develop **technical skills** to realize their ideas.
  * Students will understand and utilize tools and technology, while adapting to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn.
  * Students will be able to integrate/interface different technologies within a technological ecosystem.
* 3 – Students will develop **critical thinking skills** that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
* 4 – Students will gain knowledge of **professional practices and organizations** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation, exhibition and promotion, networking, and career preparation.
* 5 – Students will develop **collaboration skills** to actively and effectively work in a team or group.


### COURSE GOALS

This course will reinforce or introduce students to:
* the web design and development process 
* information architecture
* web usability
* content management systems
* the responsive web

This course will help students to:
* understand current content management system platforms 
* further explore issues of user experience including visual design, interaction design, information architecture, and information design
* continue to develop a vocabulary to evaluate and critique web design and development


### LEARNING OUTCOMES

By the end of the course, students will be able to
* design, build, and develop content for a professional-quality website.
* Understand and implement the iterative process
* learn how to proactively Learn also known as Self-Regulated Learning
In any learning situation, you should study beforehand, make/do, debug, reflect, adjust, and do it all over again (iteration). Learning happens in a cycle.
* create an internal developer / creative community


### COURSE STRUCTURE

Class will be comprised of lectures, critiques, show & tells, and working labs. There will be weekly homework assignments that students will present to the class, quizzes, a midterm exam and midterm and final project critiques. We will also have a guest speaker (Date to be determined, depending on their schedule). 

Critiques (AKA crits) are the best way to articulate your ideas to others and get immediate feedback. During the crit, the professor and your classmates analyze and suggest ways to increase the visual and conceptual impact of each existing idea. Take notes when your work is being critiqued and do not edit the responses, whether you agree with them or not. Review your crit notes and reflect upon what was said. Ask yourself how you could combine, transform, or expand the ideas that show the most promise. However, resist the temptation to incorporate all suggestions and comments. Only utilize the ones that work for you and your project. 

Rules of the Critique:
* Be Present and Engaged
* Give Feedback to your classmates
* Do NOT take feedback personally.

Students will conduct self assessments as well as be evaluated by the professor during or after midterm and at the end of the semester. Any action without reflection is meaningless. Real learning only occurs as part of a reflective process. Reflection is studying your own practice as seriously as you study anything. It involves thinking about why, what, and how you create something. 


### STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES

* Schedule your time (keep a calendar of some sort) 
* Come to class on time and participate (Be present and engaged)
* Study outside of class (ideally with classmate(s)
* Devote at a minimum 4 to 8 hours per week outside of class, fulfilling homework assignments, reading, and studying concepts covered in class.
* Consult basecamp at least once a week for up to date info
* Complete all assignments by due dates
* Acquire and keep up with all of the readings 
* Read all assigned readings before class
* Action – do your absolute best
* Strive for continuous improvement
* Email contact about logistics (when, where, how many?) ONLY
* Talk to me in person about issues and problems. Do not email long conversations. (If your email turns into a paragraph or two that means you should be talking to me in person, not emailing me.)
* Have Desire amounting to Enthusiasm (to learn, to explore)
* Have Patience, Persistence, and Discipline 
* Be Creative
* Pay attention to Detail & Craft
* Have Self-confidence and Pride in your work
* Take Risks & Be Fearless in your projects


### EVALUATION & GRADING

##### Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory and will be taken at the beginning of every class. Since there is so much technical, conceptual, and design information to absorb, regular attendance is essential.
* Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent (1/2 a grade point (e.g. A to an A-)) for each additional absence.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 15 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.42 percent
* Contact the professor IN ADVANCE if you will not be in class (in person or by email is preferred).
* Attendance is mandatory for the midterm and final presentations.

#### Your final grade will be based on a synthesis of quantitative & qualitative rubrics:

##### Quantitative Grading Overview

* 5% Midterm Self-Assessment
* 5% Final Self-Assessment
* 12.5% HTML Quiz
* 12.5% Portfolio PDF (see requirements below)
* 15% Show & Tells
* 25% HTML5/CSS3/Responsive flat file website
  * 25% Wordpress
  * or
  * 50% Web Application

##### Projects Grading Overview

* 40% Interface design which includes
  * Interaction and User Experience design (including tech & functionality spec)
  * Visual design (including comps, mood boards, and/or style guides)

##### Qualitative Grading Overview

Each student will be judged on the quality, experimentation, and improvement that their work shows.

###### A. Excellent (90-100)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been
of the highest level, showing sustained excellence in meeting course responsibilities. Work clearly differentiates itself from other work, has memorable impact, pursues concepts and techniques above and beyond what is discussed in class. The student thoroughly understands the web design and development process.

###### B. Very Good / Good (80-89)
Performance, participation, and attendance of the student has been good, though not of the highest level. Work demonstrates a better than average web design and development process.

###### C. Satisfactory (70-79)
Performance and attendance of the student has been adequate, satisfactorily meeting the course requirements. Work is average and competent, showing a basic understanding of the web design and development process.

###### D. Poor; Below Average (60-69)
Performance and attendance of the student has been less than adequate. Work is lacking in many or most areas that show any understanding of visual foundation. Problems may include lack of interest, procrastination, poor planning and poor craft.

###### F. Unacceptable (59 & Below)
Performance and attendance of the student has been such that course requirements have not been met. Work shows no overall understanding of the course material on many levels or either a severe lack of interest.
